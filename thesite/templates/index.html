  <h1 class="about-header" id="aboutItem">About</h1>
  <hr class="about-hr">

  <p class="about-p">The Latah Valley is a unique, special, and attractive area of the city of Spokane
    with a deep geologic and human history. The Latah Valley is home to people who deeply appreciate the attributes
    and treasures of conveniences to downtown/airport balanced with a rural feel, active farming, and a vibrant
     wildlife corridor home to moose, deer, coyote, osprey, bald eagle, and many other creatures. <br></br>
     Despite what should be protected, preserved, and a wisely planned for evolution of this area, the Latah Valley is
     under tremendous pressure by the City of Spokane and development interests whose pursuits are threatening not only
     the integrity and specialness of this area but literally the lives of the people and wildlife who call the Latah Valley home. <br></br>
     Latah Valley deserves to be protected!</p>
